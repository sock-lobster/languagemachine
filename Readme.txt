Run instructions:
Use either 'make run' or compile everything and run
LMApplication.java to run the program.

Usage:
Use the tools on the left to create an NFA, defining rules in the Transition
Options pane on the right after selecting a transition. Test strings by
typing them into the input field at the top of the screen. Options to start
a new NFA, open an old NFA, and save the current NFA can be found in the
File menu. Saved files are simply text similar to files used in the sprite
project and may be saved with any extension.
